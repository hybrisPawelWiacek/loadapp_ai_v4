## Debugging History: Validation Details Persistence Issue

### Issue Description

FAILED tests/backend/api/routes/test_route_routes.py::test_validation_details_persistence - assert None is not None

### Attempted Solutions

1. **Entity and Model Verification**
   - Confirmed `validation_details` field exists in `Route` entity with `default_factory=dict`
   - Confirmed `validation_details` field exists in `RouteModel` as JSON column

2. **Repository Updates**
   - Updated route repository's `_to_entity` method to include validation fields:
     - Added mapping for `certifications_validated`
     - Added mapping for `operating_countries_validated`
     - Added mapping for `validation_timestamp`
     - Added mapping for `validation_details`

3. **Model Modifications**
   - Modified route model to make `validation_details` non-nullable:
   ```python
   validation_details = Column(MutableDict.as_mutable(JSON), nullable=False, server_default='{}')
   ```

4. **Debug Logging**
   - Added debug logging to track validation process
   - Logs output pending review

### Recent Progress (January 4, 2024)

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identified issue with SQLAlchemy model initialization
   - Found that `validation_details` was not being properly initialized with empty dict
   - Discovered potential SQLite compatibility issues with JSON column defaults

2. **Implemented Fixes**
   - Updated `RouteModel` to use `server_default='{}'` for validation_details
   - Added explicit initialization in route creation endpoint
   - Created new Alembic migration for schema changes
   - Added validation details structure in route creation:
   ```python
   validation_details = {
       "cargo_type": cargo.cargo_type,
       "validation_type": "mock_poc",
       "mock_required_certifications": [],
       "mock_operating_countries": [],
       "route_countries": [],
       "validation_timestamp": validation_timestamp.isoformat()
   }
   ```

3. **Service Layer Updates**
   - Modified `RouteService` to initialize validation_details:
   ```python
   route = Route(
       # ... other fields ...
       validation_details={},  # Initialize with empty dictionary
   )
   ```

4. **Database Schema Changes**
   - Created new migration to update validation_details column
   - Added proper server_default value
   - Ensured SQLite compatibility

### Current Status
- Schema changes implemented and migrated
- Validation details properly initialized
- Test failures resolved
- Logging in place for validation process

### Validation Process Flow
1. Route creation starts
2. Initial validation_details structure created
3. Business validations performed
4. Validation results stored
5. Route saved with complete validation details

### Next Steps
1. Monitor validation details persistence in production
2. Consider adding validation details versioning
3. Implement cleanup for old validation data
4. Add more comprehensive validation logging
